The name element contains the name of the group. This is a short, usually less than 16 character "handle" of the group, not the real, full name.
passwd	The passwd element contains the group's password in an encrypted format. Often, for example on a system employing "shadow" passwords, an asterisk is returned instead.
gid	Group ID, should be the same as the group_id parameter used when calling the function, and hence redundant.
members	This consists of an array of string's for all the members in the group.The function returns false on failure.
